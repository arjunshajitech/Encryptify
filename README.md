# Simple E2EE Utility in Go

This utility provides easy-to-use methods for implementing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) tasks in Go.

- **ECDH** (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) for secure key exchange.
- **X3DH** (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) for advanced key exchange protocols.
- **AES-CBC** (Advanced Encryption Standard - Cipher Block Chaining) for secure encryption and decryption of messages.
