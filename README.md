# `Simple E2EE Utility in Go`

This utility provides easy-to-use methods for implementing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) tasks in Go.

## `Installation`

```bash
go get github.com/arjunshajitech/encryptify
```

## `Visit the examples for:`

- `AES`: Use AES encryption for secure communication.
- `ECDH-AES`: Secure key exchange using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) combined with AES encryption.
- `ECDH-Ed25519-AES`: Advanced key exchange with Ed25519 curve, followed by AES encryption.

`All the above examples demonstrate how to perform encryption and secure communication using Go.`
